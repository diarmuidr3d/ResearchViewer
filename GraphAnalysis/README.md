# Graph Analysis

This folder contains code for generating network statisics about the author network and outputting nodes and edges for opening in Gephi.

To use this code you must be running a SPARQL Endpoint which contains a dataset represented with http://diarmuidr3d.github.io/swrc_ont/swrc_UCD.owl

Run sparql_analysis.py in which the endpoint variable must be set to the Sparql Endpoint containing the dataset

A sample dataset is contained at WebScraper/output
